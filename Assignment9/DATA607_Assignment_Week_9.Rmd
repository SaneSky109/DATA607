# Task

The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: https://developer.nytimes.com/apis

Youâ€™ll need to start by signing up for an API key.

Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it into an R Data Frame.


# Code

Libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(kableExtra)
```

I plan to extract data from the Top Stories API which will retrieve the Top Stories from the New York Times Newspaper. I plan to extract the top stories that relate to the United States and top stories related to non-US news.


```{r}
# api key
api.key <- '2UA3cNoRNwal6giF6kSPsQFfQr1dppUa'

# Get data from API: US and World

# url for United States data
top.stories.us.url <- paste("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/us.json?api-key=", api.key, sep='')

# convert json data received from api to a data frame
us.top.stories.data <- fromJSON(top.stories.us.url) %>% 
  as.data.frame()


# url for world data
top.stories.world.url <- paste("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/world.json?api-key=", api.key, sep='')

# convert json data received from api to a data frame
world.top.stories.data <- fromJSON(top.stories.world.url) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

top.stories.us.and.world<- rbind(us.top.stories.data,world.top.stories.data)
```


```{r}
kbl(top.stories.us.and.world[1:5,]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

# Conclusion

The New York Times API make querying data fast and easy. As you can see above, it only requires a few lines of code to transform the Top Stories API into a data frame.
